# Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing internationalization (i18n) in Python applications. Internationalization ensures that software can be adapted to different languages and cultural conventions without requiring code modifications.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Locale: A set of language and cultural information used to customize the user interface and data formatting.
- Translation: The process of adapting text and other content to different languages.
- Localization: The process of adapting software to specific cultural and regional requirements.
- Message catalog: A collection of translatable messages and their translations.
- Gettext: A standard library for internationalization in C and other programming languages.
