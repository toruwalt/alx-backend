# Overview
This project explores the concept of caching in computer science. Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a faster memory storage than the main memory. This improves performance by reducing the need to access data from slower storage devices.

## Objectives
- Understand the basic principles of caching.
- Explore different caching algorithms and their use cases.
- Implement a simple caching system.
